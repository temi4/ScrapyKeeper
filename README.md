# ScrapyKeeper

A scalable admin ui for scrapy spider service 

It's fork of [ScrapyKeeper](https://github.com/fliot/ScrapyKeeper) and [SpiderKeeper](https://github.com/DormyMo/SpiderKeeper)

Contains all of the previous versions and a number of updates:
  - requirements updated to latest versions
  - in the periodic task added items:
    - Max start tasks - The number of maximum tasks that can hang on the launch and be in work
    - Number of start-ups - The number of simultaneously launched copies of scrapy
  - You can add an entry to the log QUERY <<$MY TEXT$>> and show up in completed tasks
    - $MY TEXT$ - need change
    - Itâ€™s convenient when you start the parser several times with different input parameters and want to see what happens
  - fix any bugs
